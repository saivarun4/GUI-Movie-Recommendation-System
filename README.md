# GUI-Movie-Recommendation-System
 The code creates a user-friendly movie suggestion application using Tkinter. It takes user preferences (genre, actor, rating, year) and fetches movie suggestions from a database API. Users input preferences, click a button, and get personalized movie recommendations displayed in the GUI.
